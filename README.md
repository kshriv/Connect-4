Made a simple Connect4 game! 

## My third app!
Decided to sit down over a weekend and create this simple game. What I really wanted to focus on was creating a simple yet beautiful user interface, while also finding the most efficient ways to check for a win. 



## Features:

• Has a randomized computer opponent

• Great user interface and user experience

• Displays wins during current app session

• Has a very efficient win checking a win (4 in a row) 






## So what's the point of this?

• Surely you must be thinking of how simple of a game we built, but that's where you're wrong!

• The innovation this game elicits is its [win checking ability](https://github.com/thearijain/MixIt/blob/master/ReadMePictures/isWin()%20(2).pdf).
