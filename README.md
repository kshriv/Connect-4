Made a simple Connect4 game! 

## My third app!
Decided to sit down over a weekend and create this simple game. What I really wanted to focus on was creating a simple yet beautiful user interface, while also finding the most efficient ways to check for a win. 



## Features:

• Choose from a list of songs to mix with

• Set a loop using the loop page to get a cleaner mix

• Set up to four cue points within the songs to jump around the track easier

• Access a sampler with four different sounds to overlay your mix with

• Use the crossfader to jump from deck to deck to get that perfect mix
